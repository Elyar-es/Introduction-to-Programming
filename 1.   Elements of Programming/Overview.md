**Overview.** Our goal in this chapter is to convince you that writing a computer program is easier than writing a piece of text such as a paragraph or an essay. In this chapter, we take you through these building blocks, get you started on programming in Java, and study a variety of interesting programs.

> 1.1 Elements of Programming instructs you on how to create, compile, and execute a Java program on your system.

> 1.2 Built-in Types of Data describes Java's built-in data types for manipulating strings, integers, real numbers, and booleans.

> 1.3 Conditionals and Loops introduces Java structures for control flow, including if-else statements, while loops, and for loops.

> 1.4 Arrays considers a data structure known as the array for organizing large quantities of data.

> 1.5 Input and Output extends the set of input and output abstractions (command-line arguments and standard output) to include standard input, standard drawing, and standard audio.

> 1.6 Random Web Surfer presents a case study that models the behavior of a web surfer using a Markov chain.
