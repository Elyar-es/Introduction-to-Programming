**Overview.** In this chapter, we consider a concept that has as profound an impact on control flow as do conditionals and loops: the function, which allows us to transfer control back and forth between different pieces of code. Functions are important because they allow us to clearly separate tasks within a program and because they provide a general mechanism that enables us to reuse code.

> 2.1 Static Methods introduces the Java mechanism (the static method) for implementing functions.

> 2.2 Libraries and Clients describes how to group related static methods into libraries to enable modular programming.

> 2.3 Recursion considers the idea of a function calling itself. This possibility is known as recursion.

> 2.4 Percolation presents a case study that uses Monte Carlo simulation to study a natural model known as percolation.
